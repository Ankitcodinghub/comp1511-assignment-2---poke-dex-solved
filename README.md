Introduction

For this assignment, we are asking you to implement a mini Pokédex in C. The task is split into 5 sections; each section is not weighted the same.

What is a Pokémon? What is a Pokédex?

Pokémon are fictional creatures from the Pokémon franchise, most famously from the Pokémon games. The game revolves around the (questionably ethical) capturing of these creatures. Within the fiction of this universe, a device called the Pokédex is used to catalogue all the creatures a player finds and captures.

Where can we learn more about Pokédexes?

You can play the one of the original Pokémon games here. Quite early in the game you get introduced to the Pokédex.

There’s some more information on the Pokémon Wikia.

In addition, Google will be a great resource, as the topic has been extensively written up about.

Your pokedex.c (compiled with the supplied pokemon.c and main.c) should match the behaviour of the reference implementation. Provision of a reference implementation is a common method to provide an operational specification, and it’s something you will likely

need to do outside UNSW.

If you discover what you believe to be a bug in the reference implementation, report it in the class forum. We may fix the bug or indicate that you do not need to match the reference implementation’s behaviour in this case.

You need to put code in the add_pokemon function to store the pokemon it is given into the pokedex it is given.

You don’t need to know any details about what the Pokemon type is (i.e. the type of the Pokemon pokemon argument passed to add_pokemon) to implement add_pokemon or any other function in pokedex.c.

Pokemon Tip #0: Pokemon IDs

In the Pokemon game franchise, Pokemon IDs start at 1 and go up to 809 (at the time of writing this). The first Pokemon is Bulbasaur, who has a Pokemon ID of 1. This assignment, however, allows any Pokemon ID from 0 upwards (because programmers love counting from 0).

Throughout this spec we’ll be making use of Bulbasaur (as well as some of the other official Pokemon) in our examples, but do note that you can make your own Pokemon with any ID from 0 to the maximum number that can be stored in an integer.

If you look in pokedex.h you will discover this definition: typedef struct pokedex *Pokedex

In other words the type Pokedex is the same as struct pokedex *.

struct pokedex is defined at the top of pokedex.c.

It already has one field: a pointer to struct pokenode which can be used to store a linked list.

Put in code in add_pokemon to add the pokemon it is given to the linked list whose head is in the pokedex it is given.

Hint: allocate a struct pokenode with malloc. When you run your code you should see this:

$ ./pokedex

===========================[ Pokédex ]==========================

Welcome to the Pokédex! How can I help? ================================================================ Enter command: a 1 Bulbasaur 0.7 6.9 poison grass

Added Bulbasaur to the Pokedex!

You’ll need to implement 4 more functions to find out if add_pokemon really works:

<pre>  void detail_pokemon(Pokedex pokedex);
  Pokemon get_current_pokemon(Pokedex pokedex);
  void find_current_pokemon(Pokedex pokedex);
  void print_pokemon(Pokedex pokedex);
</pre>
See pokedex.h for information on each function.

detail_pokemon and print_pokemon need to call functions defined in pokemon.h to get the information about a Pokemon they need

to print.

Note the information detail_pokemon and print_pokemon print about a Pokemon depends on whether it has been found. Hint: add a field to struct pokenode to indicate if a Pokemon has been found.

Pokemon Tip #1: finding Pokemon.

Your Pokedex is like an encyclopedia that stores information about Pokemon.

But unlike a normal encyclopaedia, some of the information in your Pokedex is hidden until you’ve discovered a Pokemon of that kind.

Once you have “found” a certain kind of Pokemon, its details will become visible to you in your Pokedex. You will need to keep track of whether a Pokemon has been found in your Pokedex implementation. Hint: add a field to struct pokenode to indicate if a Pokemon has been found.

Pokemon Tip #2: the currently selected Pokemon.

Your Pokedex allows you to scroll through the Pokemon stored within, allowing you to see the details of a specific Pokemon of your choice. This means that there will always be one Pokemon that is currently selected by the Pokedex.

When you add the first Pokemon to the Pokedex, that Pokemon becomes the currently selected Pokemon. When you add additional Pokemon, the currently selected Pokemon does not change.

In Stage 2, you will implement functions to allow you to scroll back and forth between Pokemon. But for now, you won’t need to change the currently selected Pokemon.

Hint: your currently selected Pokemon won’t change in Stage 1, and so will always be the first Pokemon added to your Pokedex (for now).

Pokemon Tip #4: scrolling through your Pokedex.

You can change the currently selected Pokemon in your Pokedex (see Pokemon Tip #2) to view the details or information about a specific Pokemon.

You can do this by either scrolling to the next and previous Pokemon in your Pokedex (using the next_pokemon and prev_pokemon functions).

You can also select a Pokemon of your choice by passing its pokemon_id to the change_current_pokemon function. Using the example from Pokemon Top #3: if your Pokedex contains the following three Pokemon in the following order, with

Pikachu currently selected:

#025: Pikachu &lt;– #007: Squirtle #050: Diglett

Calling next_pokemon would lead to Squirtle becoming the currently selected Pokemon:

#025: Pikachu #007: Squirtle &lt;– #050: Diglett

Calling prev_pokemon would lead to Pikachu becoming the currently selected Pokemon again:

#025: Pikachu &lt;– #007: Squirtle #050: Diglett

And calling change_current_pokemon with the pokemon_id 50 would lead to Diglett becoming the currently selected Pokemon:

#025: Pikachu #007: Squirtle #050: Diglett &lt;–

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
You must implement these functions in pokedex.c:

<pre>  void next_pokemon(Pokedex pokedex);
  void prev_pokemon(Pokedex pokedex);
  void change_current_pokemon(Pokedex pokedex, int pokemon_id);
  void remove_pokemon(Pokedex pokedex);
  void destroy_pokedex(Pokedex pokedex);
</pre>
Again, see pokedex.h for information on what each function should do, and use 1511 pokedex_reference to see what the correct behaviour is.

Note that as time goes on, you may need to update destroy_pokedex to make sure it’s cleaning up all the memory in a Pokedex instance. Keep this in mind.

Stage 3: Finding Pokémon

A Pokémon trainer will be venturing out into the wild, meeting and cataloguing Pokémon. These functions will allow you to go exploring and to mark certain Pokémon as “found” in your Pokédex.

For this, you need to complete:

Stage 4: Evolutions

What’s this? Your Pokédex code is evolving? To finish this evolution of your Pokédex, implement these functions in pokedex.c:

<pre>  void add_pokemon_evolution(Pokedex pokedex, int from_id, int to_id);
  void show_evolutions(Pokedex pokedex);
  int get_next_evolution(Pokedex pokedex);
</pre>
Again, see pokedex.h for information on what each function should do, and use 1511 pokedex_reference to see what the correct behaviour is.

Stage 5: Getting Sub-Lists Set up your Pokédex to do some nice searching!

<pre>  Pokedex get_pokemon_of_type(Pokedex pokedex, pokemon_type type);
  Pokedex get_found_pokemon(Pokedex pokedex);
  Pokedex search_pokemon(Pokedex pokedex, char *text);
</pre>

Testing

As you implement functions in pokedex.c, you should add tests to test_pokedex.c . It already has some basic tests.

$ ./test_pokedex

Welcome to the COMP1511 Pokedex Tests!

<pre> ==================== Starter Tests ====================
</pre>
<pre> &gt;&gt; Running a very basic new_pokedex test
     ... Creating a new Pokedex
     ... Checking that the returned Pokedex is not NULL

Test passed!

As usual autotest is available with some simple tests – but your own tests in test_pokedex will be more useful. $ 1511 autotest pokedex

File Redirection

Every time you run your application, instead of re-typing all the details of each given Pokémon you’re adding to the Pokédex, you can store the input for your application in a separate file, and run it using:

$ ./pokedex &lt; test1.in &gt; test1.out

Then check that your file test1.out contains the correct information given the input file. A example test1.in might be

Submission of Work

You are required to submit intermediate versions of your assignment.

Every time you work on the assignment and make some progress you should copy your work to your CSE account and submit it using the give command below.

It is fine if intermediate versions do not compile or otherwise fail submission tests. Only the final submitted version of your assignment will be marked.

All these intermediate versions of your work will be placed in a git repo and made available to you via a web interface at this URL, replace z5555555 with your zID:

https://gitlab.cse.unsw.edu.au/z5555555/19T1-comp1511-ass2_pokedex/commits/master This will allow you to retrieve earlier versions of your code if needed.

You submit your work like this:

$ give cs1511 ass2_pokedex pokedex.c test_pokedex.c

Assessment

This assignment will contribute 13% to your final mark.

80% of the marks for this assignment will be based on the performance of the functions you write in pokedex.c.

20% of the marks for assignment 2 will come from hand marking of the readability of the C you have written. These marks will be awarded on the basis of clarity, commenting, elegance and style. In other words, your tutor will assess how easy it is for a human to read and understand your program.

Tutors will also examine the tests you add to test_pokedex.c function. Here is an indicative marking scheme.

Due Date

This assignment is due Tuesday 13 August 11:59:59

If your assignment is submitted after this date, each hour it is late reduces the maximum mark it can achieve by 3%. For example if an assignment worth 74% was submitted 5 hours late, the late submission would have no effect. If the same assignment was submitted 15 hours late it would be awarded 55%, the maximum mark it can achieve at that time.
